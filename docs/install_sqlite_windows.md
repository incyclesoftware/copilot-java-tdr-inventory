How to Install SQLite3 on Windows
=================================

You can install the SQLite3 command-line tool on Windows by downloading the precompiled binaries and setting up your environment. Here’s how:

1. **Download the Precompiled Binaries:**
   - Go to the [SQLite Downloads page](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
   - Under the “Precompiled Binaries for Windows” section, download the `sqlite-tools-win32-x86-*.zip` file.

2. **Extract the Files:**
   - Unzip the downloaded file to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\sqlite3`).

3. **Add SQLite to Your PATH:**
   - Open the Start Menu, search for “Environment Variables”, and select “Edit the system environment variables.”
   - Click on “Environment Variables.”
   - Under “System variables,” find and select the `Path` variable, then click “Edit.”
   - Click “New” and add the path to the folder where you extracted the SQLite binaries (e.g., `C:\sqlite3`).
   - Click “OK” to apply the changes.

4. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type `sqlite3`.
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see the SQLite prompt.

**Alternative Methods:**
- **Chocolatey:** If you have Chocolatey installed, run:
  ```
  choco install sqlite
  ```
- **Scoop:** If you prefer Scoop, run:
  ```
  scoop install sqlite
  ```

You will need to add sqlite into your PATH manually.
